				<h2 style = "margin-top: 0;">1. Outline the Content</h2>

				<p>

					Firstly, decide on the working title and the main outlines. Remember that a working title is more specific than a topic. Next, make a list of the main outlines to start giving the PowerPoint structure. While outlining, it is crucial to keep the target audience in mind. In doing this, try to ask some questions to yourself:

				</p>

				<ul>

					<li>What does the audience already know?</li>
					<li>What new information should be provided?</li>
					<li>What is going to interest the audience?</li>
					<li>How do we make the audience constantly focused?</li>

				</ul>

				<span id = "item-2"></span>

				<h2>2. Collect Relevant Data and Examples</h2>

				<p>

					Data and examples can greatly boost your presentation credibility. While statements can help to set a good presentation structure, supporting the statements with credible evidence will make the presentation far more interesting. However, keep in mind to not provide random statistics on the presentation and expect to amaze the audience. Make sure that the data comes from reliable/reputable sources. Furthermore, present it in an interesting way and make it easy to understand, such as charts and graphs.

				</p>

				<span id = "item-3"></span>

				<h2>3. Select Proper Color Schemes</h2>

				<p>

                    Set up color combinations that look more appealing. Select the colors that support the tone of the presentation content and legibility. In addition, be sure that the color scheme doesnâ€™t distract the audience. Be mindful not to utilize too many different colors combination since it may ruin the slides.

				</p>

				<span id = "item-4"></span>

				<h2>4. Design the Slide Backgrounds</h2>

				<p>

                    While designing, avoid unnecessary images or decorations that might distract the audience. However, it is also imperative to make more creative designs than just having plain backgrounds even for very simple ones. Most PowerPoint apps have provided templates that can be used as a starting point. In addition, most of the templates contain creative and simple designs which are very suitable. 

				</p>

				<span id = "item-5"></span>

				<h2>5. Format the Content</h2>

				<p>

                    Start filling in information based on the outline created earlier. Firstly, create a skeleton by adding the title, all the headers, and supporting slides in between. Moreover, here are the following that can be added to the slides:

				</p>

				<ul>

					<li>Titles and headers</li>
					<li>A few credible information/statements</li>
					<li>One or two images</li>
					<li>Details to remember</li>

				</ul>

				<p style = "margin-top: 125px;">
				
					It is crucial to fill in the information and then add the images later. Make sure that the information in the slides is summarized and save the whole information for the speech. Therefore, you can start creating your presentation by following these tips for maximum impact.
