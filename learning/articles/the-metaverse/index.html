					Many questions are asked about the metaverse. All of these questions point to the same conclusion, everyone can benefit from it. By the rate of the metaverse's increasing popularity and speed in development, it could even be our future. With this blog, learn about the metaverse and its components.

				<h2>Some Definitions of the Metaverse:</h2>

				<p>

					The metaverse is considered many things. But in the broadest definition, the metaverse is a network of virtual worlds. These worlds are mostly made up of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies.

					<br><br>

					In the metaverse, it is possible to interact with people and objects. Some people believe that interactions made in the metaverse will replace real-life interactions in the distant future. For now, these interactions consist of talking, writing, reading, gestures, and sharing visuals.

					<br><br>

					In the metaverse, users can buy property. This property could be stored as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). An NFT represents and proves the uniqueness of the property. After the property is bought, the buyer can transform it into whatever they want. Besides property, users can also own digital assets. These assets can be anything, from art to experience. These assets can also be stored as secure NFTs.

				</p>

				<span id = "item-2"></span>

				<h2>Components of the Metaverse:</h2>

				<p>

					Many types of technologies form the metaverse. The list of these technologies continues to grow each passing day. The following are some of the well-known components.
				
				</p>

				<h3>1. Web 3.0</h3>

				<p>

					Web 3.0 is designed to be an open-source system. This means it is publicly accessible and safer than closed source. In Web 3.0, everyone is expected to own their data; in other words, personal privacy is respected. It is the goal of Web 3.0 to establish secure infrastructure and communication through verifiable channels. If these goals are achieved, it would mean a safer cyber future for humanity.

				</p>

				<h3>2. Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>

				<p>

					Virtual Reality creates non-physical environments with scenes and objects. Virtual Reality allows the user to visit lots of entirely different locations without traveling. The only thing needed to access all these is a VR headset/helmet.

				</p>

				<h3>3. Augmented Reality (AR)</h3>

				<p>

					Augmented Reality enhances objects in the real world across multiple sensory modalities. The differences between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality could be hard to understand. But, VR creates an entirely different environment, and AR adds to the real-life environment at hand.  

				</p>

				<h3>4. Mixed Reality (MR)</h3>

				<p>

					Mixed Reality combines AR, VR, and the real world. Entirely new virtual elements are added to the real-life environment. AR and MR might seem like the same thing, but MR is an even more enhanced form of AR. 

				</p>

				<h3>5. 3 Dimensional (3D)</h3>

				<p>

					The world as we see it is 3D. AR, VR, and MR (which are main components of the metaverse) are also 3 Dimensional. In a 3D space, 3 values are required to find an object's location.

				</p>

				<h3>6. Non-Fungible Token (NFT)</h3>

				<p>

					An NFT is evidence of the digital equivalent of a physical asset which could be an image, audio file, or video. NFTs are unique, but their ownership can be transferred. This makes it possible for NFTs to be sold or traded.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p>

					The metaverse is humongous! And it continues to evolve with the help of new and improved technologies. But most importantly, people want to believe that the metaverse will be better than the world we live in today. Let's wait and seeâ€¦
