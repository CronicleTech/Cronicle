				<p>
					
					Due to a recent data breach incident in my country, I feel like now would be a good time to talk about how to keep yourself safe and secure on the ever-growing internet (and I swear, it's not going to be an N*rdVPN ad or its sort). Being secure doesn't simply mean keeping yourself or your privacy safe from hacker attacks, but also understanding how to prevent yourself from getting scammed.

					<br><br>

					Now, you might ask, "Why should I bother taking extra measures to protect my online privacy and whatnot? It's not like I have anything to hide there or use the internet for transactions."

					<br><br>

					In response to that statement, please allow me to walk in and out of your home since you have nothing suspicious to hide. With that out of the way, let's get down to what things you need to pay attention to.

				</p>

				<span id = "item-1"></span>
				
				<h2>Passwords</h2>

				<p>
					
					<b>Rule 1</b> : Under no circumstance tell anyone or anything your password.

					<br><br>

					<b>Rule 2</b> : It's simple- a good password is a long password. That's it. There's no need to make it complicated (although using numbers and special characters is a fantastic idea). "treesaregreen123!" is a safer password than "2qz3w12m" because it has more characters.

					<br><br>

					<b>Rule 3</b> : This might be a pain, but don't use the same password for everything.

				</p>

				<span id = "item-2"></span>

				<h2>Phishing Sites</h2>

				<p>

					Phishing is an attempt to trick you into giving your personal information, which the attacker can use to steal your money or identity. No stranger on the internet would be kind enough to provide you with free stuff.
