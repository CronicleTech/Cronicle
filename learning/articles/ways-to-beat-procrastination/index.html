					Procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something knowing that it will most likely have negative consequences. This action is done unnecessarily and voluntarily. People ages 14 to 29 are affected by procrastination the most, but it happens to the best of people no matter their age. It is a common belief that procrastinating means that the person is “lazy”, but actually it is because of the person's subconscious fear of failure. Here are 3 ways of beating procrastination:

				<h2>1. Make a To-Do List</h2>

				<p>

					To-do lists are beneficial for people who want to track when and what to do. Which is basically our typical procrastinator. Besides keeping track, to-do lists motivate the user by helping them clearly see what they are capable of. This gradually increases their self-confidence and reduces their fear of failure. For these lists to be even more motivating, it is suggested to make daily lists. This way the to-do list is even more planned and focused on the goal.

				<h2 style = "margin-top: 150px;">2.	Eliminate Distractions</h2>

				<p>

                    To complete all the tasks you have planned in your to-do lists, there shouldn’t be any unnecessary distractions. To figure out what these distractions are, check screen time and decide the suitable action to follow. 

					<br><br>

					For example, if the most used app is Instagram (for leisure), contemplate on logging out, freezing/deleting your account or deleting the app completely. Adapting to these changes will be hard but it will get easier eventually. In the end these changes will all be worth it, because of the extra time you get for completing tasks and the serenity that comes to you for not wasting precious energy on useless cluttering information.

				<h2 style = "margin-top: 150px;">3.	Pat Yourself on the Back</h2>

				<p>

                    Congratulate yourself! Even if it is small wins, every step you take towards your goal is a step to success. Motivating yourself is a crucial step in eliminating the “fear of failure” mindset. Therefore, it will move you farther and farther away from being a procrastinator.
                    
					<br><br>

					In conclusion, procrastination happens all inside the person's mind. It is in the person's power to keep a leash on the negative and demotivating thoughts. Follow these steps and gradually you will forget what being a procrastinator ever felt like.
